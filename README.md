## Inspiration - Purpose

This is an introductory simple 4-page website, developed with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap) that contains basic information about my career, my interests and my future ambitions.

Its first version was used as a solution to Problem Set 8: Homepage of Harvard's CS50x 2023 and the purpose of this project was to get accustomed with these front-end technologies that the course's lectures only scratched the surface of.

Thus, the "mission accomplished" part of the project was to teach myself how to learn a new technology (JS, Bootstrap) or new things in technologies I've already used in the past (HTML, CSS).

The project's main goals are:

- To present myself in a more "Web Developer" way on GitHub as well as other platforms
  
- To practice on a project I've already created for another reason in the past (CS50x), aspects like mobile responsiveness, git and other features of the implemented technologies

## Features - Usage

The website, although completely static as it has no backend interaction, uses simple user-friendly and interactive ways to present information like:

- Revealing hidden information after submission of a form by the user (triggering an event)
  
- Organizing information in user-friendly and responsive patterns or advanced Bootstrap elements like carousel

- Presenting (in terms of UI design) the whole content of the website as a small journey, using fixed sections that apply to all pages (header, sidebar) as well as redirect buttons to the end of each page
